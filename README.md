Ultimate Sim Sports
===================

This project is now going to be completely closed source at this time. Maybe I will open it up but I want to have this idea as an option ot make money in the future but I want to try to have it free to the public when it launches.  

I hope to have everything done in around a year. If anyone is interested in helping out with any part of the web game, please let me know. I would love to have some help with this project. 

Uses
====================
UserFrosting - Group and User Authentication
Basketball GM - As a guide for building the simulation engine, not reusing the code as it uses indexedDB which will not work with this idea.
PHP
JS
jSON
AJAX
HTML5
Bootstrap


Features
===================

- Dynasty
- College Basketball
- College Football
- Pro Football
- Pro Basketball
- Pro Baseball
- College Baseball

More to come when I have everything completed. 

Looking for more interested parties for helping to code this web game.
